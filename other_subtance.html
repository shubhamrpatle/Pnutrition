                        Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For distilled spirits, a standard serving in the
                        United States is
                        1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80 proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories. Wine
                        and beer
                        contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but
                        these beverages
                        also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A
                        12-ounce
                        serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories. According to the U.S. Department of
                        Agriculture, based on
                        NHANES 2013-2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and men consume
                        on average
                        15.5 grams/day. Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average
                        ethanol calorie
                        contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods
                        because other
                        than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.

                            Phytochemicals such as polyphenols are compounds produced naturally in plants (phyto means
                            "plant" in
                            Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that are prevalent in plant foods, but are
                            not proven to
                            be essential for human nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that
                            polyphenols or
                            other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits, mainly because these
                            compounds have poor
                            bioavailability, i.e., following ingestion, they are digested into smaller metabolites with
                            unknown
                            functions, then are rapidly eliminated from the body.

                        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20"> While initial studies sought to reveal if dietary supplements might promote health, one
                            meta-analysis
                            concluded that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins A and E and beta-carotene did not
                            convey any
                            benefits, and may increase risk of death.[84] Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not
                            impact mortality
                            rate. Health effect of non-nutrient phytochemicals such as polyphenols were not assessed in
                            this review.
