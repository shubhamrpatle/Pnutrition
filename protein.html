              Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and
              form the enzymes
              that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of
              amino acids which
              contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive
              smell of
              burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new
              proteins
              (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). Amino acids are soluble
              in the digestive
              juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed,
              they cannot be
              stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the
              urine.[medical citation
              needed] Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect
              and defining
              characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition.

              For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally so
              they must be
              eaten) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other
              nitrogen-containing compounds).
              About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential.
              The synthesis of
              some amino acids can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as
              prematurity in the
              infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress, and those are called conditionally
              essential.

              A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential)
              is particularly
              important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation,
              or injury (a
              burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an
              incomplete protein
              source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids. It is possible with protein
              combinations of two
              incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and
              characteristic
              combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary
              sources of
              protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body. Excess
              amino acids
              from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called
              gluconeogenesis.

              There is an ongoing debate about the differences in nutritional quality and adequacy of
              protein from vegan,
              vegetarian and animal sources, though many studies and institutions have found that a
              well-planned vegan or
              vegetarian diet contains enough high-quality protein to support the protein requirements of
              both sedentary
              and active people at all stages of life.
