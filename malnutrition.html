                <p class="indent-20">
                    Undernutrition, which includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low
                    height-for-age) and
                    underweight (low weight-for-age)
                    Micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies or
                    insufficiencies (a lack of
                    important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess
                    Overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease,
                    stroke, diabetes and
                    some cancers)
                </p>
                <p class="indent-20 mb-10">
                    In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with
                    nutritional imbalances
                    or excessive consumption; there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to
                    excessive
                    consumption. According to the United Nations World Health Organization, the greatest
                    challenge in developing
                    nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients
                    necessary for the growth
                    and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to
                    inadequate
                    macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like "household
                    food security,
                    maternal and child care, health services, and the environment.

                    The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended
                    Dietary
                    Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and RDAs are part of Dietary Reference
                    Intakes. The
                    DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.

                    The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for
                    vitamins and
                    minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to
                    cause health
                    problems. ULs are part of Dietary Reference Intakes. The European Food Safety Authority
                    also reviews the
                    same safety questions and set its own ULs.

                    When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper
                    amount of other
                    nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced. High calorie food ingredients such as
                    vegetable oils, sugar
                    and alcohol are referred to as "empty calories" because they displace from the diet foods
                    that also contain
                    protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.
