                    A nutrient is a substance used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for
                    dietary
                    nutrient intake applies to animals, plants, fungi, and protists. Nutrients can be incorporated into
                    cells
                    for metabolic purposes or excreted by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as hair, scales,
                    feathers, or exoskeletons. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the
                    process
                    of releasing energy, such as for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and fermentation products (ethanol
                    or
                    vinegar), leading to end-products of water and carbon dioxide. All organisms require water.
                    Essential
                    nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the amino acids that are combined to create
                    proteins,
                    a subset of fatty acids, vitamins and certain minerals. Plants require more diverse minerals
                    absorbed
                    through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. Fungi live on dead or living
                    organic
                    matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.</p><br>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
                    Different types of organisms have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is
                    essential,
                    meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but some
                    animals
                    and plants are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be organic or inorganic: organic compounds
                    include most
                    compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include
                    nutrients
                    such as iron, selenium, and zinc, while organic nutrients include, among many others,
                    energy-providing
                    compounds and vitamins.</p><br>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
                    A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into
                    macronutrients
                    and micronutrients. Consumed in relatively large amounts (grams or ounces), macronutrients
                    (carbohydrates,
                    fats, proteins, water) are primarily used to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for
                    growth and
                    repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts (milligrams or micrograms); they have subtle
                    biochemical and physiological roles in cellular processes, like vascular functions or nerve
                    conduction.</p><br>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
                    Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a
                    deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary
                    nutrient intakes, such as the United States Dietary Reference Intake, are based on deficiency
                    outcomes[clarification needed] and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and
                    upper
                    limits of intake. </p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20"><br>In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant
                    content[clarification
                    needed] are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger
                    quantities
                    than the body needs may have harmful effects. Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds
                    generally
                    called phytochemicals which have unknown effects on disease or health, including a diverse class
                    with
                    non-nutrient status called polyphenols, which remain poorly understood as of 2017.</p><br>

                        Carbohydrates are compounds made up of types of sugar. Carbohydrates are classified according to
                        their
                        number of sugar units: monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose), disaccharides (such as
                        sucrose
                        and lactose), oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose).
                        Proteins are organic compounds that consist of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Since the
                        body
                        cannot manufacture some of the amino acids (termed essential amino acids), the diet must supply
                        them.
                        Through digestion, proteins are broken down by proteases back into free amino acids.<br>
                        Fats consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acids attached. Fatty acid molecules
                        contain a
                        -COOH group attached to unbranched hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds alone (saturated
                        fatty
                        acids) or by both double and single bonds (unsaturated fatty acids). Fats are needed for
                        construction
                        and maintenance of cell membranes, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the
                        health of
                        skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed essential fatty
                        acids),
                        they must be obtained through one's diet.<br>

                        Dietary minerals are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of

                        minerals are essential to human metabolism.
                        Vitamins are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as coenzymes or cofactors

                        various proteins in the body.

                            Essential nutrients :

                            synthesized in the body – either at all or in sufficient quantities – and thus must be
                            obtained from a
                            dietary source. Apart from water, which is universally required for the maintenance of
                            homeostasis
                            in mammals, essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular metabolic
                            processes and for
                            the maintenance and function of tissues and organs. The nutrients considered essential
                            for humans
                            comprise nine amino acids, two fatty acids, thirteen vitamins, fifteen minerals and
                            choline. In
                            addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients
                            since they
                            are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.
