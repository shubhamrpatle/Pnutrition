          Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living
          organisms, other than the four
          elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. Some have
          roles as cofactors, while others are electrolytes. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to
          describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned –
          including several metals, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be
          supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from
          natural inorganic sources (such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some are absorbed much more
          readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added
          to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter.

          Calcium (Ca2+) is vital to the health of the muscular, circulatory, and
          digestive systems; is indispensable
          to the building of bone; and supports the synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, calcium is
          used to regulate the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. It can play this
          role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially
          proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubility, enabling the formation of the
          skeleton.[57]</p><br>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
          Chlorine as chloride ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below.
          Magnesium, required for processing ATP and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis,
          increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all
          inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat,
          tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.
          Phosphorus, required component of bones; essential for energy processing. Approximately 80% is found in
          the inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important
          metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. It is an important
          electrolyte in the form of phosphate. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry,
          whole-grain cereals, and many others.</p><br>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
          Potassium, a common electrolyte (heart and nerve function). With sodium, potassium is involved in
          maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is
          important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, nuts,
          vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.
          Sodium, a common food ingredient and electrolyte, found in most foods and manufactured consumer products,
          typically as sodium chloride (salt). Excessive sodium consumption can deplete calcium and magnesium.[62]
          Sodium has a role in the etiology of hypertension demonstrated from studies showing that a reduction of
          table salt intake may reduce blood pressure.</p><br>

          Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually
          because they play a catalytic
          role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200 mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:[medical
            citation needed] Cobalt as a component of the vitamin B12 family of coenzymes Copper required component of
            many redox enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase (see Copper in health) Chromium required for sugar
            metabolism Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxin, but probably, for other important
            organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see Iodine deficiency); for this reason iodine is
            needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals; 
            Nowadays it is most easily found in iodized salt, but there are also natural sources such as Kombu.
            Iron required for many enzymes, and for hemoglobin and some other proteins Manganese (processing of oxygen)
            Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases Selenium required for peroxidase (antioxidant
            proteins) Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase, liver alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic
            anhydrase </p><br>
            <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Ultratrace minerals</h1>
            <img src="https://image.slideserve.com/1454870/ultra-trace-minerals-l.jpg" alt="error">
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20" >
              
              Ultratrace minerals are an as yet unproven aspect of human nutrition, and
              may be required at amounts
              measured in very low ranges of μg/day. Many ultratrace elements have been suggested as essential,
              but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the
              characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function.
