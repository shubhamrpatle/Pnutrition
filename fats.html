              A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and
              hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached
              to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the chemical
              structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid
              chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so
              their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length.
              Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many
              double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain,
              unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of
              unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they
              are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. There are nine kilocalories
              in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and
              punicic acid, in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

              Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia.
              Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.
              Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while
              unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil). Trans fats are very rare in
              nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food
              processing industry, such as rancidity resistance.

                    Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty
                    acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential
                    and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty
                    acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both
                    of these "omega" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as
                    prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body.

                    The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential
                    fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block
                    for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA)
                    serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic
                    acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA
                    and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly
                    through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative
                    production of different prostaglandins. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts
                    of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of
                    omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
                    The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and
                    PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away
                    from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). The conversion
                    (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by
                    hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation).
