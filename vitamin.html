                            A vitamin is an organic molecule (or a set of molecules closely related chemically, i.e.
                            vitamers) that is an essential micronutrient which an organism needs in small quantities for
                            the proper functioning of its metabolism. Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the
                            organism, either at all or not in sufficient quantities, and therefore must be obtained
                            through the diet. Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others; it is not
                            a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second. The term vitamin does not include the
                            three other groups of essential nutrients: minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential
                            amino acids.[2] Most vitamins are not single molecules, but groups of related molecules
                            called vitamers. For example, there are eight vitamers of vitamin E: four tocopherols and
                            four tocotrienols. Some sources list fourteen vitamins, by including choline,[3] but major
                            health organizations list thirteen: vitamin A (as all-trans-retinol,
                            all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A
                            carotenoids), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin
                            B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folic acid
                            or folate), vitamin B12 (cobalamins), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D (calciferols),
                            vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), and vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinones).
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent-20 mb-6">Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions. Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue
                            growth and differentiation. Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function, regulating mineral
                            metabolism for bones and other organs. The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors
                            (coenzymes) or the precursors for them. Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants.[7] Both
                            deficient and excess intake of a vitamin can potentially cause clinically significant
                            illness, although excess intake of water-soluble vitamins is less likely to do so.

                            <br> This means that these vitamins are required for the body to
                            work properly. They are:Vitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Vitamin B1
                            (thiamine), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B3 (niacin),

                            Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body's liver, fatty tissue, and muscles. The four
                            fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are absorbed more easily by
                            the body in the presence of dietary fat.
                            <br>
                            Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body. The nine water-soluble vitamins are
                            vitamin C and all the B vitamins. Any leftover or excess amounts of these leave the body
                            through the urine. They have to be consumed on a regular basis to prevent shortages or
                            deficiencies in the body. The exception to this is vitamin B12, which can be stored in the
                            liver for many years.
                            Some vitamin-like nutrients are also needed by the body such as:<br>
                            Choline
                            <br> Carnitine

                        Each of the vitamins listed below has an important job in the body. A vitamin deficiency occurs
                        when you do not get enough of a certain vitamin. Vitamin deficiency can cause health problems.
                        Not eating enough fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified dairy foods may
                        increase your risk for health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and poor bone health
                        (osteoporosis).<br>
                        Vitamin A helps form and maintain healthy teeth, bones, soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin.<br>
                        Vitamin B6 is also called pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 helps form red blood cells and maintain brain
                        function. This vitamin also plays an important role in the proteins that are part of many
                        chemical reactions in the body. The more protein you eat the more pyridoxine your body requires.
                        Vitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It also helps form red
                        blood cells and maintain the central nervous system.<br>
                        Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes healthy teeth and gums. It
                        helps the body absorb iron and maintain healthy tissue. It is also essential for wound healing.<br>
                        Vitamin D is also known as the "sunshine vitamin," since it is made by the body after being in
                        the sun. Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine 3 times a week is enough to produce the body's
                        requirement of vitamin D for most people at most latitudes. People who do not live in sunny
                        places may not make enough vitamin D. It is very hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources
                        alone. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. You need calcium for the normal development and
                        maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain proper blood levels of calcium
                        and phosphorus.<br>
                        Vitamin E is an antioxidant also known as tocopherol. It helps the body form red blood cells and
                        use vitamin K.<br>
                        Vitamin K is needed because without it, blood would not stick together (coagulate). Some studies
                        suggest that it is important for bone health.<br>
                        Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the production of
                        hormones and cholesterol.<br>
                        Niacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It also has
                        cholesterol-lowering effects at higher doses.<br>
                        Folate works with vitamin B12 to help form red blood cells. It is needed for the production of
                        DNA, which controls tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who is pregnant should be sure to
                        get enough folate. Low levels of folate are linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. Many
                        foods are now fortified with folate in the form of folic acid.<br>
                        Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is essential for the metabolism of food. It also plays a role in
                        the production of hormones and cholesterol.<br>
                        Riboflavin (vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth and the
                        production of red blood cells.<br>
                        Thiamine (vitamin B1) helps the body cells change carbohydrates into energy. Getting enough
                        carbohydrates is very important during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is also essential for
                        heart function and healthy nerve cells.<br>
                        Choline helps in normal functioning of the brain and nervous system. Lack of choline can cause
                        swelling in liver.<br>
                        Carnitine helps the body to change fatty acids into energy.
