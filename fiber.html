              Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and
              in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories)
              of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited
              absorption and digestibility.The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Insoluble dietary fiber</h1>

              Includes cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have
                    the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of
                    microbes that can do so. Includes resistant starch, an insoluble starch that resists digestion either
                    because it is protected by a shell or food matrix (Type 1 resistant starch, RS1), maintains the natural
                    starch granule (Type 2 resistant starch, RS2), is retrograded and partially crystallized (Type 3 resistant
                    starch, RS3), has been chemically modified (Type 4 resistant starch, RS4) or has complexed with a lipid
                    (Type 5 resistant starch, RS5). Natural sources of resistant starch (RS1, RS2 and RS3) are fermented by
                    the microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are utilized as food for
                    the colonic cells or absorbed.

              Comprises a variety of oligosaccharides, waxes, esters, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize
              in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human
              digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric
              content.
              Whole grains, beans, and other legumes, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good
              sources of dietary fiber. Fiber has three primary mechanisms, which in general determine their health
              impact: bulking, viscosity and fermentation.[37] Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and
              insoluble fiber facilitates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move
              contents along the digestive tract. Some soluble and insoluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity;
              this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Fermentable fibers are
              used as food by the microbiome, mildly increasing bulk, and producing short-chain fatty acids and other
              metabolites, including vitamins, hormones, and glucose. One of these metabolites, butyrate, is important as
              an energy source for colon cells, and may improve metabolic syndrome.
