          The human body contains chemical compounds such as water, carbohydrates, amino acids (found in proteins),fatty
      acids (found in lipids), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). These compounds are composed of elements such as
      carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional statusmust take into
      account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole
      diet and of all the materials excreted and eliminated from the body (including
      urine and feces).
    </p><br>

    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
      The seven major classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water.
      Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients (needed in small quantities). Carbohydrates,
      fats, and proteins are macronutrients, and provide energy. Water and fiber are macronutrients but do not provide
      energy. The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.
    </p><br>
    
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
      The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are
      built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and energy. Some of the
      structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in Joules
      or kilocalories (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c'
      calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately (4 kcal) of energy per gram, while fats
      provide 37 kJ (9 kcal) per gram,[8] though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and
      digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.
    </p><br>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
      Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class
      of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both
      mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males on
      average need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age
      until the second or third decade of life.
    </p><br>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
      Some nutrients can be stored – the fat-soluble vitamins – while others are required more or less continuously.
      Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a
      required nutrient. Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized by the body, and must be obtained from food.
    </p><br>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
      Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from
      simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are
      triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all,
      are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in
      addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.[11] The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing
      amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino
      acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as
      ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be
      produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally
      when atrophy takes place, or during periods of starvation.
