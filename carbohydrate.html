                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides or
                    polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of
                    chemical physical and physiological properties. They make up a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread,
                    and other grain-based products, but they are not an essential nutrient, meaning a human does not
                    need to eat carbohydrates. The brain is the largest consumer of sugars in the human body, and uses
                    particularly large amounts of glucose, accounting for 20% of total body glucose consumption. The brain
                    uses mostly glucose for energy; if glucose is insufficient however, it switches to using fats.

                Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more.
                Monosaccharides include glucose, fructose and galactose. Disaccharides include sucrose,
                lactose, and
                maltose; purified sucrose, for instance, is used as table sugar. Polysaccharides, which
                include starch
                and glycogen, are often referred to as 'complex' carbohydrates because they are typically long
                multiple-branched chains of sugar units.

                Traditionally, simple carbohydrates were believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore raise
                blood-glucose
                levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.
                Some simple
                carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g., fructolysis) that
                result in only a
                partial catabolism to glucose, while, in essence, many complex carbohydrates may be digested at
                the same
                rate as simple carbohydrates. The World Health Organization recommends that added sugars
                should
                represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.

                The most common plant carbohydrate nutrient – starch – varies in its absorption. Starches have
                been
                classified as rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch.
                Starches in
                plants are resistant to digestion (resistant starch), but cooking the starch in the presence of
                water can
                break down the starch granule and releases the glucose chains, making them more easily
                digestible by human
                digestive enzymes. Historically, food was less processed and starches were contained within
                the food
                matrix, making them less digestible. Modern food processing has shifted carbohydrate
                consumption from
                less digestible and resistant starch to much more rapidly digestible starch. For
                instance, the
                resistant starch content of a traditional African diet was 38 grams/day. The resistant
                starch
                consumption from countries with high starch intakes has been estimated to be 30-40
                grams/day. In
                contrast, the average consumption of resistant starch in the United States was estimated to be
                4.9 grams/day
                (range 2.8-7.9 grams of resistant starch/day).
