               Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces, sweating, and by water vapour
                in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.
        
                Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that six
                to eight glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. However, the notion that a
                person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source.
                The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research
                Council read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food.</p><br>
                <p class="paragraph indent-20 mb-6"> Most of
                this quantity is contained in prepared foods." More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on
                fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good
                health.[50] Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in
                two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and
                (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were
                provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with "desirable
                osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.</p><br>

            <p class="paragraph indent-20">
                For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult
        females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other
        beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with
        the remaining 20% coming from food. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with
        fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using
        country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United
        Nations.
    </p><br>
    <p class="paragraph indent-20">
        The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly
        are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is
        increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require
        additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same
        volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement,
        equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an
        additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and
        over-hydration – too little and too much water, respectively – can have harmful consequences. Drinking too
        much water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium
