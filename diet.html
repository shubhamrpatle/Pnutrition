          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by
            a person or other organism. The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for
            health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each
            culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes
            or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.</p><br>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
            Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from
            protein anessential fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate,
            protein, and fat. Dietarhabits and choices play a significant role in the quality of life, health and
            longevity.</p><br>

          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
            A healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with
            essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate
            fibre and food energy.</p><br>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4 indent-20">
            A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food
            or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and
            animal-based foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.
            Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on
            what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to
            allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.</p><br>
